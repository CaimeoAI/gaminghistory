            <p class="lead desc">Eating dots with Pac-Man, rescuing the princess with Mario and Luigi, or wiping out your opponents in Fortnite: over about three generations now, video games have shaped the childhood of millions of people. A look back at 50 years of gaming history.</p>
            <hr class="hr-white">
            <p>Today, video games make up a $100 billion global industry, and nearly two-thirds of American homes have household members who play video games regularly. And it’s really no wonder: Video games have been around for decades and span the gamut of platforms, from arcade systems, to home consoles, to handheld consoles and mobile devices. They’re also often at the forefront of computer technology.</p>
            <p>The desire to play is as old as humanity itself. For children, it’s a vital tool to prepare them for life, and for adults, it’s a way of escaping from reality and having a few moments of entertainment to yourself. Like almost all aspects of life, gaming too has moved into the digital world in recent decades. In 2018, one third of the world’s population regularly spent time playing video games, whether on their mobile phone, a games console or a computer. The triumphant rise of the video game began in the 1970s, but has its roots in events that happened about 20 years earlier.</p>

            <h2>The Gaming Industry</h2>
            <hr class="hr-white">
            <p>The video game industry is the industry involved in the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.</p>
            <p>The video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream in the recent years. As of 2018, July, video games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually worldwide. In the US, it took in about US$ 9.5 billion in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010, according to the ESA annual report.</p>
            <p> Modern personal computers owe many advances and innovations to the game industry: sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements. Sound cards, for example, were originally developed for an addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later were they improved for the music industry. Graphics cards were originally developed to provide more screen colors; and later on to support graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games. This drove the need for higher resolutions and 3D acceleration.</p>
